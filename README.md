    <h1>Movie Recommendations using Python</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the Movie Recommendations GitHub repository! In this project, we use Python to provide personalized movie recommendations based on various factors such as user preferences, genre, and ratings.</p>
    <h2>How it Works</h2>
     <p>This movie recommendation system is built using Python and a dataset of movies. We employ collaborative filtering techniques and machine learning algorithms to suggest movies that users might enjoy based on their past preferences and behaviors. The code is structured and documented for easy understanding and customization.</p>
     <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>To get started with the movie recommendation system, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
       <li>Clone this repository to your local machine.</li>
        <li>Install the required dependencies by running: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
         <li>Run the recommendation script using: <code>python recommend_movies.py</code></li>
          </ol>
